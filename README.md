- 👋 Hi, I’m @Carlospop1999
- 👀 I'm interested in learning to program in different programming languages and being self-taught with the help of new technologies as well as helping
- new people interested in this wonderful world.
- 🌱  I'm currently learning web programming, in html, css, php, javascript and several frameworks like laravel. Although I try to learn more in other
- languages that I have some knowledge such as Phthon, Java, c#, c++.
- 💞️ I’m looking  to collaborate in several projects to improve my analytics and understanding of the code to get a good job. 
- 📫 How to reach me on my social networks, my email and on my GitHub profile.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm from Mexico with few months of experience in Web Programming. Graduated from Tecnológico de Estudios Superiores de Cuautitlán Izcalli.
